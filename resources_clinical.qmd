: Questions that can be used when considering each principle in the AI development process [@Badal2023-bt] {#tbl-healthcare-guiding-principles}


### Principle 1: AI tools should aim to alleviate existing health disparities

Reaching health equity requires eliminating the disparitities in health
outcomes that are closely linked with social, economic, and environmental
disadvantages. At their very core, AI tools require collection of specialized
and high-quality data, advanced computing infrastructure for use, capacity to
purchase or partner models from commercial entities, and unique technical
expertise, all of which are less likely available to healthcare systems that
serve the most disadvantaged populations. 

More careful training and model development that accounts for the unique needs
of disadvantaged populations is needed to ensure that AI tools do not
exacerbate existing health disparities. Creating equitable AI tools may require
prioritizing simpler models for deployment, and the trade-off between balancing
accuracy and equity can potentially be resolved by designing AI tools that can
be easily tailored to the local population. AI tools designed to serve
disadvantaged groups must not unnecessarily divert resources from higher
priority areas and more effective interventions ([Principle
4](#principle-4-ai-tools-should-have-high-healthcare-value-and-avoid-diverting-resources-from-higher-priority-areas)).

### Principle 2: AI tools should produce clinically meaningful outcomes

AI tools should be evaluated based on their ability to improve clinically
meaningful outcomes. The clinical benefit of AI tools should be defined in the
context of the existing standard of care, and the AI tool should be evaluated
against this standard. If AI practitioners do not define clinical metrics for
clinical benefit _a priori_, they risk producing tools that clinicians cannot
evaluate or use. Clinician partners of AI researchers should evaluate accuracy,
fairness, and risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment ([Principle
3](#principle-3-ai-tools-should-reduce-overdiagnosis-and-overtreatment)). They
should also evaluate the healthcare value ([Principle
4](#principle-4-ai-tools-should-have-high-healthcare-value-and-avoid-diverting-resources-from-higher-priority-areas))
along with the explainability and auditability of AI tools and models (note
principles outlined in @tbl-healthcare-guiding-principles.

### Principle 3: AI tools should reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment

Particularly in the United States, overdiagnosis and overtreatment are major
drivers of healthcare costs and patient harm. Overdiagnosis occurs when a
disease is diagnosed that would not have caused symptoms or death in a
patient’s lifetime. Overtreatment occurs when a patient is treated for a
disease that would not have caused symptoms or death in a patient’s lifetime.
AI tools should be carefully constructed with the spectrum of disease and
interventions to result in decreased overdiagnosis and overtreatment. 

### Principle 4: AI tools should have high healthcare value and avoid diverting 
resources from higher-priority areas

AI tools applied in healthcare should result in the same outcomes for reduced
cost or better outcomes for costs comparable to current costs. Costs to gather
inputs, build, maintain, update, interpret, and deploy in clinical practice
must be estimated and included in weighing the decisions around AI tool
application. Note that what might be cost-effective, leading to high healthcare
value, in one setting might be extremely cost-ineffective in settings where
resources are scarce. 

### Principle 5: AI tools should incorporate social, structural, environmental,
emotional, and psychological drivers of health

### Principle 6: AI tools should be easily tailored to the local population

### Principle 7: AI tools should promote a learning healthcare system

### Principle 8: AI tools should facilitate shared decision-making
