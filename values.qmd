# Values and Principles

While there are many potential applications for LLMs in healthcare, the
following guiding principles should be considered when developing and deploying
LLMs in the academic hospital system. Note that these principles largely apply
to any Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning applications in use on the
campus.

## Vision Statement

* LLMs must be used in a manner consistent with the mission, vision, and values
  of the academic hospital system. 

* The use of LLMs must align with relevant legal and regulatory requirements,
  including but not limited to data privacy, security, and intellectual
  property laws. 

* The deployment of LLMs should prioritize patient safety, privacy, and
  wellbeing. 

* LLMs must be used in a transparent manner, with users understanding the
  capabilities and limitations of the technology. 

* Continuous improvement and evaluation of LLM usage should be prioritized to
  ensure ongoing alignment with organizational goals. 

## Stakeholder Considerations 

### Patients 

* LLMs should be used to augment patient care and improve outcomes, without
  replacing the human touch and empathy of healthcare providers. 

* Patients must be informed about the use of LLMs in their care, and they
  should have the option to opt out if desired. 

* Patient data used in LLM applications must be anonymized, encrypted, and
  securely stored to protect patient privacy. 

### Healthcare Providers 

* LLMs should be deployed to enhance clinical decision-making and efficiency
  without undermining the autonomy and expertise of healthcare providers. 

* Adequate training and support should be provided to healthcare providers to
  ensure proper use and understanding of LLMs. 

* Feedback from healthcare providers must be regularly solicited to improve LLM
  performance and usability. 

### Researchers 

* The use of LLMs in research must adhere to ethical standards, including
  obtaining informed consent and minimizing potential harm. 

* Collaboration between researchers and LLM developers should be encouraged to
  drive innovation and address specific research needs. 

* Research involving LLMs should be transparent and reproducible, with results
  and methodologies made available to the wider scientific community. 

### Administrators and Support Staff 

* LLMs should be deployed in administrative and support functions to improve
  efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the overall quality of service. 

* Staff should receive appropriate training and support to understand and
  utilize LLMs effectively. 

* Employee feedback should be actively sought to identify areas of improvement
  and potential new applications for LLMs. 

## Monitoring and Compliance 

* A designated LLM Steering Committee, comprising representatives from various
  stakeholder groups, will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing
  compliance with this policy. 

* Periodic audits and assessments will be conducted to ensure adherence to this
  policy and identify areas for improvement. 

* Policy violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including
  termination of employment or access to LLMs
