# Domain Implementation Guide

Each Domain will work to meet the needs of the campus that align with its
community membership and mission. This section provides a rough guide (adapted
from @lindegaard-vb)  to implementing a LLM plan within the Domains. Each
Domain can work through this guide to develop policies, plans, resources, and
deliverables. The combination of cross-domain Workstreams and reporting to the
AISC will help to align resource requests and facilitate knowledge sharing,
management, and transfer.

## Suggested Tasks

### Establish Ownership Leadership

Assign a Domain leader and convene a Domain Working Group (represented in blue
boxes in @fig-framework) as the driving force behind ChatGPT implementation.
This leader and Working Group members need to become proficient in the
technology and subsequently guide the organization through the process of
integration. This includes setting the vision, aligning key stakeholders, and
ensuring that the implementation aligns with the organization's strategic
goals.

In practice, this Domain leader will be the primary point of contact for the
AISC and will be responsible for reporting on the Domain's progress and
deliverables. The Domain leader will also be responsible for convening the
Domain Working Group and ensuring that the Domain's Workstreams are
progressing.


### Lean Into Cross-functional Collaboration

Form a cross-functional team with representatives from HR, IT, Legal, and other
relevant departments to ensure that various perspectives are considered, and
organizational needs are met during ChatGPT implementation. This collaboration
will help address potential challenges, optimize resources, and facilitate
effective knowledge transfer across the organization.

### Educate Leadership Teams

Keep leadership teams informed about ChatGPT to
   enable swift, informed decision-making. Offer workshops and seminars to
   provide an in-depth understanding of the technology, its potential benefits,
   and its limitations. This empowers them to make quick, informed decisions
   that will shape the organization's adoption and use of the technology.

### Identify Potential Use Cases

Map potential applications across all
   functions and establish a cohesive implementation plan. Conduct thorough
   analyses of business processes and functions to identify areas where ChatGPT
   can bring significant value, prioritize these use cases, and create a
   detailed roadmap for implementation, including timelines and milestones.

### Craft a Communication Strategy

Develop a comprehensive communication
   strategy that addresses employee concerns and questions about the
   implementation of ChatGPT. This approach should be transparent, informative,
   and reassuring to ensure a smooth transition. It should also highlight the
   benefits of the technology and address potential misconceptions.

### Prepare and Integrate High-Value Proprietary Datasets

Build APIs and interfaces to combine
   ChatGPT with organization-specific data for improved innovation and
   efficiency. Invest in the development of custom solutions that seamlessly
   integrate ChatGPT with existing systems, databases, and workflows to fully
   harness the potential of the technology.

### Create Employee Training and Support

Provide comprehensive training programs that laverage publicly available
content where possible for employees to effectively use ChatGPT in their daily
work. Offer hands-on workshops, e-learning modules, and on-the-job training to
equip employees with the skills and knowledge necessary to use ChatGPT
effectively. Provide ongoing support and resources to help employees adapt to
the new technology and address any challenges they may face.

### Monitor Progress and Impact

Regularly assess the performance of
   ChatGPT within the organization and evaluate its impact on specific use
   cases. Develop key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to track the
   technology's effectiveness, and use this data to inform future improvements
   and adaptations.

### Develop Continuous Improvement and Adaptation

Stay current with AI advancements
   and adapt ChatGPT implementation to maximize benefits. The AI landscape is
   constantly evolving, and it's crucial to stay up-to-date with advancements
   in the field. Continuously evaluate the performance of ChatGPT and be
   prepared to adapt its implementation to maximize its benefits and stay ahead
   of the competition.

### Recognize, Document, and Build Processes to Address Ethical Considerations

Develop guidelines for responsible use and educate
    employees on potential risks and challenges of AI technologies like
    ChatGPT. Be mindful of the ethical implications of using AI-powered
    technologies. Develop guidelines and best practices for responsible use,
    and ensure that employees understand the potential risks and challenges
    associated with AI, such as algorithmic bias or unintended consequences.
