  abstract = "Several principles have been proposed to improve use of
              artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, but the need for AI
              to improve longstanding healthcare challenges has not been
              sufficiently emphasized. We propose that AI should be designed to
              alleviate health disparities, report clinically meaningful
              outcomes, reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment, have high
              healthcare value, consider biographical drivers of health, be
              easily tailored to the local population, promote a learning
              healthcare system, and facilitate shared decision-making. These
              principles are illustrated by examples from breast cancer
              research and we provide questions that can be used by AI
              developers when applying each principle to their work.",
