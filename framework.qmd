In order to successfully integrate AI and Large Language Models into an
academic medical system, it is essential to adopt a flexible and agile approach
that accounts for the varying pacing, priorities, and levels of risk associated
with different aspects of the institution. By organizing the implementation
plan into distinct domains and workstreams (see @fig-framework), we can address the unique
requirements of each area, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively
and progress is made at an appropriate pace. This structure also enables rapid
adaptation to changing circumstances, allowing for seamless collaboration
between various teams and promoting a proactive response to any challenges that
may arise. Ultimately, the use of domains and workstreams fosters a
comprehensive and resilient approach to AI integration, maximizing the
potential benefits while minimizing potential risks across the entire academic
medical system. Note that the framework is not intended to be prescriptive or
exhaustive; rather, it is meant to serve as a starting point for discussion, planning,
and implementation. A top-level coordination unit (e.g., a steering committee) will
work with the domain areas as a resource and to ensure that the overall
implementation plan is aligned with the institution's strategic goals and
priorities.

Domains (vertical dimension) capture semi-independent organizations, each with largely independent use cases, budgets and business plans, priorities, and leadership. The workstreams (horizontal dimension) will often require similar or overlapping expertise, and can serve as knowledge resources to provide synergy and uniformity in implementation across domains."

## Domains
The implementation plan for integrating AI and Large Language Models into an
academic medical system consists of four main domains: 

* Education
* Research
* Clinical
* Business Operations

### Education 
This domain includes all activities related to teaching,
  learning, and evaluation within the institution. It also encompasses the
  development of new educational programs and the management of existing ones.

### Research
This domain focuses on the practice of the basic, clinical, and
  translational research programs within the institution. In addition, it
  includes the management of research grants, the development of new research
  programs, and the dissemination of research findings.

### Clinical
This domain encompasses all activities related to patient care, including
  the management and implementation of clinical services, decision support and
  clinical decision-making, automation, and point-of-care or electronic patient
  support. 

### Business Operations
This domain focuses on the management of the institution's business
  operations, including finance, human resources, information technology, and
  facilities management. It also includes the development of new business
  processes and the management of existing ones.


## Workstreams

Within each domain, we have identified five workstreams that are critical for
the successful implementation of AI and Large Language Models. These
workstreams are:

* Data Access & Use
* IT, Security, & Infrastructure
* Ethical, Legal, & Social
* Training & Workforce Development
* Project Management & Support Personnel

### Data Access & Use 
This workstream focuses on managing and optimizing data access, use, and
sharing within the academic medical system. It ensures that data is available,
reliable, and secure for AI integration and that the necessary infrastructure
is in place to support data-driven activities.

### IT, Security, & Infrastructure
This workstream addresses the technical aspects of AI integration, including
the development and maintenance of IT systems, ensuring data security, and
providing the necessary hardware and software infrastructure to support AI and
Large Language Models.

### Ethical, Legal, & Social
This workstream focuses on the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI
integration in the academic medical system with domain-specific focus as
appropriate. It aims to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically and
that any legal and social concerns are addressed proactively.

### Training & Workforce Development
This workstream is dedicated to developing the skills and knowledge of domain
community members (including staff _and_ leadership) within the domain to
understand and, where appropriate, to effectively use and manage AI and Large
Language Models. It includes training programs, workshops, and other
educational opportunities to build competency in AI-related technologies. 

### Project Management & Support Personnel
This workstream is responsible for ensuring that the project management of AI
and Large Language Models across the four domains. Among its roles are to
provide project management, helping to align resource requests, support
services around the usage of LLMs. This group will also cooordinate support
staff who work collaboratively within and across domains to  to ensure that AI
integration occurs smoothly and efficiently.

The implementation plan is structured in a way that allows for cross-functional
collaboration between the domains and workstreams. This ensures that AI and
Large Language Models are integrated cohesively across the entire academic
medical system, maximizing the benefits and minimizing potential risks.
